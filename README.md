This is an interactive Twitch Chat bot that can be modified to fit into any streamer's chat.
This currently can read and display messages from Twitch Chat directly inside of the console, and
will respond to the streamer inputting chat commands into twitch chat directly using the TwitchLib API.
The current functionality involves the user, such as the channel's streamer or a viewer, inputting commands
like "!game" which will display the correct response associated with the command.

To run: You first need to put your Twitch given Stream Key, and Twitch Account name into the Resource Explorer.
After you've done this, you'll want to make an account for your bot with a new email and information that isn't your own.
After setting this up, you'll want to head to https://twitchtokengenerator.com/ and give the appropriate permissions to your bot.
Once this is complete, and your bot's twitch account is set up, you can now run the program and the bot will join your chat at
Twitch.tv/(YourChannel) and respond to your chat commands while logging your twitch chat.
